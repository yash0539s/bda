. 1D (Linear) Data Visualization

Purpose: Show distribution of a single variable.

Example: Distribution of age

Steps in Tableau:

Connect to the Adult dataset in Tableau.

Drag age to Columns.

Drag Number of Records to Rows.

Change Marks type to Bar or Histogram.

Right-click age → Create → Bins to adjust bin size if needed.

✅ Shows how many individuals fall into different age ranges.

b. 2D (Planar) Data Visualization

Purpose: Show relationship between two variables.

Example: age vs hours-per-week

Steps:

Drag age to Columns.

Drag hours-per-week to Rows.

Change Marks to Circle (Scatterplot).

Drag income to Color to differentiate <=50K and >50K.

✅ Helps visualize if older people work more or less per week and how income is distributed.

c. 3D (Volumetric) Data Visualization

Purpose: Represent three numeric variables.

Example: age, hours-per-week, capital-gain

Steps (using color or size as the third dimension):

Drag age → Columns, hours-per-week → Rows.

Change Marks → Circle.

Drag capital-gain → Size or Color.

Optional: drag income → Color for categorical distinction.

✅ This simulates a 3D view since Tableau doesn’t natively support 3D plots.

d. Temporal Data Visualization

Purpose: Show trends over time.

Note: Adult dataset doesn’t have a real time variable, but we can use age as a pseudo-temporal variable to show trends.

Example: Average hours-per-week by age

Steps:

Drag age → Columns.

Drag AVG(hours-per-week) → Rows.

Change Marks → Line.

Optionally, drag income → Color to see differences.

✅ Shows how work hours change with age for different income groups.

e. Multidimensional Data Visualization

Purpose: Show multiple variables at once.

Example: age, hours-per-week, capital-gain, income

Steps:

Drag age → Columns, hours-per-week → Rows.

Change Marks → Circle.

Drag capital-gain → Size.

Drag income → Color.

✅ Enables exploration of multiple dimensions in one chart.

f. Tree / Hierarchical Data Visualization

Purpose: Show hierarchical relationships.

Example: education → occupation → income

Steps:

Drag education → Columns.

Drag occupation → Rows.

Drag Number of Records → Size.

Drag income → Color.

Change Marks → Treemap.

✅ Visualizes which occupations dominate per education level and income group.

g. Network Data Visualization

Purpose: Show connections between categories.

Example: Connections between workclass and occupation

Steps:

Create a nodes/edges table from the dataset:

Source: workclass
Target: occupation
Weight: count of records


Connect this table to Tableau.

Use Path/Line chart or a Network Graph extension.

Map Weight → line thickness or color.

✅ Shows which workclasses are most connected to which occupations.
